# Auction
This project simulates a distributed auction platform featuring a central Bank, multiple 
Auction Houses, and multiple Agents — each running as a separate application. Agents can
interact with auction houses to bid on items, and funds are managed securely through the
bank.

## Project Structure
* Bank/ – Manages account creation, fund blocking, and transfers.
* Auctionhouse/ – Hosts and manages auction items. Accepts bids from agents.
* Agent/ – JavaFX-based GUI allowing users to view, bid, and track auctions.
* items.txt – List of item names for auction houses to sell.
* README.md – This file.
